asks for a password to encrypt a file- uses xchacha20-poly1305 (very modern and trusted) 

encrypts in memory (no streaming) so it is reliable and simple as long as you have enough ram. 

lockr encrypt test.txt testenc.txt   

lockr decrypt testenc.txt textdecrypted.txt

very simple to use. 

Can be used as is, yet is made to be easily edited. Feed to ai in order to audit or make any changes 

In this app, simplicity is a strategy !
