tfish-cli is a dead-simple, production-grade file locker built on the Threefish-1024 block cipher with a misuse-resistant SIV design. You point it at a file once; it auto-detects whether to encrypt or decrypt and does the job in place using a safe temp-and-rename workflow. Keys come from your password via Argon2id (with compile-time memory/iteration/parallelism settings), and every byte is authenticated with a Skein-512â€“based HMAC so tampering or a wrong password is caught before any plaintext is released. It streams large files in fixed-size chunks, works the same on Windows/macOS/Linux, and uses fresh randomness each run so identical inputs never produce the same ciphertext. In short: strong crypto, minimal ceremony, one command.
